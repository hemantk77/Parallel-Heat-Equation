# Parallel-Heat-equation
Hello everyone, this project is about implementing a parallel solver for the heat equation using finite differences method and OpenMP.

This Heat equation in Mathematics and Physics is a partial differential equation, which is used to model how heat diffuses through a given region. The solution of the heat equation provides you the distribution of heat in a region over time. Here, we are using the Finite Differences method and OpenMP to solve this equation in parallel.

We are going to write two different types of code, one Serial and the other Parallel, and compare their executional time to show which one is better.
